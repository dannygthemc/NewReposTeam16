#Team 16 - The Weather v1.0

##ABOUT

This simple weather app is able to display current, short term, and long term weather information, including minimum and maximum temperatures, sky condition, wind speed & direction, and humidity. The app allows the user to search from over 70,000 cities, displays the weather on Mars, and saves the user’s previously searched locations. 

Weather information is gathered using OpenWeatherMap’s [free API](http://openweathermap.org/api). Mars weather data is made available by the [Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System API](http://marsweather.ingenology.com), which transmits information collected by the Curiosity Rover on Mars.

##RUNNING THE PROGRAM

*__Want to install and use the program?__* Just download our prepackaged, ready-to-use .jar file by clicking [here](https://github.com/UWO-2212-W2015/team16/blob/master/target/16-TheWeather.jar?raw=true), and simply double-click to use. Installation time is minimal, and the app is very quick to use. If you are experiencing any performance issues, please allow some extra time for the app to load your results as OpenWeatherMap’s API can be slower when handling a higher request load. 

*__Want to contribute?__* Download all the source files [here](https://github.com/UWO-2212-W2015/team16/tree/master/src/main/java). You will also need to [download imgscalr](http://www.thebuzzmedia.com/software/imgscalr-java-image-scaling-library/) – an image scaling library used in displaying the weather icons. 
To build the package using the Maven build tool, type the following commands into Git Bash: 

```
mvn compile

mvn package
```
